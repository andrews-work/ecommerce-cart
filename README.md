## JavaScript Expertise

I've effectively utilized JavaScript to implement various aspects of this ecommerce shopping cart application:

1. **Frontend-Backend Interaction:**
   The application demonstrates my proficiency in frontend-backend integration. The frontend interacts with the backend server to manage cart data and initiate payment processing.

2. **State Management and Context API:**
   I've employed the Context API to manage global state, showcasing my expertise in state management. The cart context manages product quantities and interactions within the cart.

3. **Conditional Rendering and User Interaction:**
   The app leverages conditional rendering to display appropriate buttons and information based on the user's interaction with the cart. I've demonstrated my ability to create dynamic and responsive UIs.

4. **API Integration (Stripe):**
   Integrating the Stripe API for payment processing underscores my competence in integrating third-party APIs and handling secure transactions.

5. **Asynchronous Operations and Fetch API:**
   The app makes asynchronous requests to the backend server for checkout and cart management. This highlights my understanding of asynchronous programming and HTTP requests.

6. **Mapping and Data Manipulation:**
   The product and cart data is mapped and manipulated, reflecting my skill in processing and displaying structured data.

7. **Component Structure and Modularization:**
   I've structured the app with modular components, improving code organization and reusability. This showcases my architectural and code structuring skills.
